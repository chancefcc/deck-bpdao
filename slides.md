# **The Unseen Challenge** (1/2)

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">

**The Problem:** The global resource recycling industry, including critical sectors like **battery and lead recycling**, is hampered by **operational opacity, fragmented data, and a fundamental lack of trust.**

**The Barriers:** This creates significant **compliance hurdles** for operators, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It also **blocks their access to traditional financing** because they lack the verifiable operational data required by lenders.

# **The Unseen Challenge** (2/2)

- **Inefficient Capital Flow:** The traditional recycling industry suffers from slow capital turnover and limited funds, hindering large-scale development.
- **Opaque Value Assessment:** The true environmental value of recycled materials is difficult to quantify, leading to uneven value distribution across the supply chain.
- **Information Asymmetry:** Recycling data is fragmented, lacking unified standards and shared platforms, which impedes industry efficiency.
- **Insufficient Incentive Mechanisms:** Recycling participants (especially at the front-end) lack sufficient economic incentives, and their environmental enthusiasm needs to be improved.
- **Complex Cross-border Transactions:** International trade of recycled materials involves complex aspects such as multi-country regulations, payment settlements, and logistics.

# Data: The Untapped Asset

- **Industry Observation:** The traditional recycling industry has gone through three stages:
  - v1.0 - Individual struggle in data silo
  - v2.0 - Alliance cooperation, but with _Centralized Procurement Model_
  - v3.0 - Open Sharing, the emerging _Digital Certification Transformation_ era.

- **The Injustice:** In the v2.0 stage, practitioners and operators continuously created valuable data streams, but their ownership and economic benefits did not form an effective market and pricing system, and the creators did not receive due returns from the valuable data.

**“_We have the opportunity to drive industrial data from isolation to aggregation, and from aggregation to digital certification and value-added financing._”**

# SoEasy Network v3.0 Solutions

- **RWA Integration:** Transform recycling data (e.g., recycling volume, types, environmental contributions) into quantifiable Real-World Assets (RWA), and anchor them with digital tokens via blockchain. These tokens represent the environmental value generated by recycling activities and future revenue rights.
- **Digital Token Incentives:** Reward data providers and recycling participants with digital tokens (points), realizing _data as asset_. The sustainable issuance mechanism of digital tokens will solve the problem of limited traditional funds, provide continuous financial support for the ecosystem, bringing in huge potential returns.
- **Global Unified Platform:** Establish a global recycling data trading and management platform to achieve data sharing, value transparency, and efficient circulation.
- **Empowerment Model:** SoEasy Network does not compete with existing recycling enterprises but empowers all participants in the industry chain, helping them convert their environmental contributions into **tradable carbon credit value**, achieving a win-win for all parties.
- **Efficient Cross-border Payments:** Provide blockchain-based cross-border payment services (PayFi), enabling T+0 settlement and lower fees, simplifying international trade processes.

# SoEasy Business Model (1/3): Core Philosophy

SoEasy Network's core business model is to build an _Environmental Value Circular Ecosystem_ based on RWA and digital assets. Data providers (new energy equipment manufacturers, recycling companies, individual practitioners) integrate and synchronize anonymized data through operational tools to receive **token (point) rewards**.

These points can circulate and be traded within the platform, and cross-chain confirmation and transactions can be realized in the future. Through data mining and analysis, SoEasy Network will improve the efficiency and transparency of the entire recycling industry chain and ultimately convert environmental contributions into **tradable carbon assets**.

# SoEasy Business Model (2/3): RWA and Digital Tokens

- **Anchored Assets:** SoEasy Network's tokens are anchored to verified recycling data and the environmental contributions they represent (e.g., reduced carbon emissions, saved resources).
- **Value Capture:** As global attention to environmental protection and carbon emissions increases, and as the SoEasy Network platform expands in scale and accumulates data, the intrinsic value of digital tokens will continue to rise.
- **Funding Pool:** The sustainable issuance mechanism of digital tokens will build a self-sufficient funding pool, providing long-term impetus for SoEasy Network's operations and ecosystem incentives.

# **资源再生未被看见的挑战** (1/2)

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">

**问题所在：** 全球再生资源行业，包括**电池和铅回收**等关键领域，长期受困于**运营不透明、数据碎片化和信任缺失**。

**发展障碍：** 这为运营商，特别是中小企业 (SME)，带来了巨大的**合规障碍**。由于缺乏可验证的运营数据，他们也**难以获得传统金融机构的融资支持**。

<!--
 在现代经济中，数据是我们身份和工作的核心部分。然而，在传统的回收行业，运营商对自己产生的宝贵数据没有真正的所有权。他们的数字记录和交易历史可以随时被中心化平台修改或删除，使他们无法掌控自己的数字足迹。

 （铺垫范式转移的机会）
 加入例子：传统行业缺乏数字化运营能力，传统靠人的判断，是买方市场，但数据的缺失导致了信息不对称和不公平竞争。这部分有巨大的提效增值空间。为解决这个行业问题，构建数据平台服务市场参与者并给予他们经济回报。例如，一家小型电池回收商可能无法准确评估其库存价值，因为缺乏标准化的数据格式和共享机制。
 (铺垫联网数据的价值，联网数据的价值在于它能够提供透明度和可追溯性，帮助运营商更好地管理其业务，提高效率和盈利能力。)

# **资源再生未被看见的挑战** (2/2)

- **资金流转效率低：** 传统回收行业资金周转慢，资金量受限，难以支撑规模化发展。
- **价值评估不透明：** 回收物的真实环保价值难以量化，导致产业链上下游价值分配不均。
- **信息不对称：** 回收数据分散，缺乏统一标准和共享平台，阻碍行业效率提升。
- **激励机制不足：** 回收参与者（尤其是前端）缺乏足够的经济激励，环保积极性有待提高。
- **跨境交易复杂：**  国际回收物资交易涉及多国法规、支付结算和物流等复杂环节。

# **数据：尚未开发的资产**

- **产业观察：** 传统回收行业经历了三个阶段：
  - v1.0 - 单打独斗
  - v2.0 - 联盟合作（集采模式）
  - v3.0 - 开放共享（数证化转型）。

- **不公之处：** v2.0 阶段从业者和运营商持续不断地创造着宝贵的数据流，但其所有权和经济利益没有形成有效市场和价格体系，创造者并未从可估值到数据中获得应有的回报。

「我们有机会驱动产业数据从孤立到聚合、从聚合到数证化共享。」

<!--
每一笔回收交易、每一次物流运输和每一个处理环节都产生了海量的运营和财务数据。这些信息是优化供应链、创建实体资产通证化 (RWA) 项目、确保税务合规以及构建新型金融服务的金矿。然而，创造这些数据的企业却被隔绝在其巨大的价值之外。

# 易收国际商业模式（1/3）

## 核心理念：
易收的核心商业模式是构建一个基于 RWA 和数字资产的「环保价值循环生态系统」。数据提供者（新能源装备制造企业、回收企业、从业者个人）透过运营工具集成同步脱敏数据，获得数字通证（积分）奖励。这些积分可以在平台内流通、交易，未来可实现跨链确认和交易。通过数据挖掘和分析，易收将提升整个回收产业链的效率和透明度，并最终将环保贡献转化为可交易的碳资产。

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

<div>

```html
<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" />
```

<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" scale="0.65" />

</div>
</div>

<!--
Presenter note with **bold**, *italic*, and ~~striked~~ text.

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-default/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-seriph/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

# Clicks Animations

You can add `v-click` to elements to add a click animation.

<div v-click>

This shows up when you click the slide:

```html
<div v-click>This shows up when you click the slide.</div>
```

</div>

<br>

<v-click>

The <span v-mark.red="3"><code>v-mark</code> directive</span>
also allows you to add
<span v-mark.circle.orange="4">inline marks</span>
, powered by [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/):

```html
<span v-mark.underline.orange>inline markers</span>
```

</v-click>

<div mt-20 v-click>

# Motions

Motion animations are powered by [@vueuse/motion](https://motion.vueuse.org/), triggered by `v-motion` directive.

```html
<div
  v-motion
  :initial="{ x: -80 }"
  :enter="{ x: 0 }"
  :click-3="{ x: 80 }"
  :leave="{ x: 1000 }"

```

<div class="w-60 relative">
  <div class="relative w-40 h-40">
    <img
