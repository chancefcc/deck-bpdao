# The Problem:
## A Trillion-Dollar Industry Plagued by Opacity

The global renewable resources industry is vital for a sustainable future, but it's fundamentally broken by a lack of trusted data.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 pt-8">
<div class="p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg">

### Data Fragmentation & Mistrust
Operators, recyclers, and regulators work in silos with inconsistent data, leading to disputes and massive value leakage.

</div>
<div class="p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg">

### Compliance & Financing Barriers
Without verifiable operational data, proving compliance is a burden and accessing capital is nearly impossible for the SMEs that form the industry's backbone.

</div>

<p class="text-center text-xl">
<b>This creates a cycle of inefficiency, hinders growth, and locks out institutional capital.</b>

# The Solution:
## A Single Source of Truth

**`teb.network` (Trusted Eco Bridge) is a decentralized data oracle that bridges real-world operations with _verifiable financial data_.**

We transform messy, real-world operational data into trusted, auditable financial records, anchored immutably on-chain.

<div class="p-8 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg">

### Our Core Innovation

**1. Bridge Operational & Financial Data**
<p class="text-sm">
Our open source `teb` SDK helps business operators capture granular data at the source (recycling transactions, logistics, etc.). The platform then verifies this data, creating a trusted ledger for financial auditors.
</p>

**2. Facilitate Pre-listing Equity Valuation**
<p class="text-sm">
By creating auditable revenue streams, we build the foundation of trust required for credible valuation assessments, connecting a recycle business' operation intelligence to modern finance.
</p>

</div>

<br>
<div class="p-8 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg">

**`teb.network` unlocks the true value of real-world assets by making them transparent, verifiable, and financeable.**

# How It Works: Technology Overview

Our distributed architecture ensures data integrity from the physical world to the digital ledger.

<br>

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 text-center">

<div class="p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">1. Capture</h3>
  <p class="text-sm">TEB Nodes with our open-source `teb` SDK are deployed at operational sites, capturing real-world events (transactions, logistics) as immutable, cryptographically signed records.</p>
</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">2. Verify & Transact</h3>
  <p class="text-sm">The teb.network platform verifies the data and enables it to be used in a decentralized Data Marketplace. The TEB token facilitates transactions and incentivizes network integrity.</p>
</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">3. Anchor</h3>
  <p class="text-sm">Cryptographic proofs of the verified data are periodically anchored to a public blockchain, creating a globally auditable record. This underpins the value of the Real-World Assets (RWA).</p>
</div>

</div>

<br>

<p class="text-center">
Our open-source and AI-native operation intelligence tool suite, the `TEB` CLI and SDK, empowers global operators to easily integrate, contribute data.
